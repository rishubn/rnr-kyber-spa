## RNR-ML-KEM SPA & SASCA

Initial Release:

This repository implements the Redundant Number Representation (RNR) countermeasure for ML-KEM described in the paper: "Efficient SPA Countermeasures using Redundant Number Representation with Application to ML-KEM". In addition, we provide the measurement scripts for simulated and practical SASCAs (using the CW308 board and Picoscope 6000). Trace datasets will be made available at a later date. If there are missing files, please file a Github issue and I will fix it promptly.
